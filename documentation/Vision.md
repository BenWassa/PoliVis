# Vision

## Design Philosophy (UX/UI Direction)

**Tone:** Calm, intelligent, and apolitical — no outrage bait, no bias.

**Style:** Minimalist, data-driven cards with color cues (party tones, issue tags).

**UX Principles:**

- Tap once → Learn something valuable
- Swipe → Discover context
- Long-press → Access depth (news, sources, analysis)

**Visual Inspiration:**

- The Oura App for data calmness
- Apple News' typography hierarchy
- Glassmorphism / Neumorphism for subtle depth

## Target User & Value Proposition

**Audience:** Young professionals, students, and civic newcomers who want to feel competent and confident about politics — not overwhelmed.

**User Promise:** "Get up to speed on who's running your province or country — at a glance."

**Emotional Hook:** It's not about politics as tribal warfare. It's about orientation — knowing the landscape so you can think critically and engage meaningfully.

## Problem Statement

As a young professional in Ontario (and Canada more broadly), staying informed about politics feels daunting. Traditional media and government websites are dense, outdated, and hard to connect with emotionally. The result is a sense of detachment — most people should care about provincial or federal politics, yet don't know:

- Who their representatives are
- What they stand for
- What's currently being debated or voted on
- How left/right political leanings actually translate into policy differences

The core problem isn't apathy — it's accessibility. Modern citizens need a visually engaging, intuitive tool that bridges the gap between political data and human understanding.

## 2. Vision

Civic Lens is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to make politics personal, visual, and immediately understandable. It presents Canadian political figures (starting with Ontario MPPs) through a clean, stylized interface that merges profiles, policies, and perspectives — giving users the ability to explore who's shaping their world and how.

Think of it as a "Pokédex for politics" — approachable, aesthetic, and data-driven.
